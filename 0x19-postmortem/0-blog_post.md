## Timeline:
- **June 3, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC):** The gremlins were spotted wreaking havoc through our monitoring alerts, triggering a state of emergency.
- **Detection Method:** Our trusty monitoring system sounded the alarm bells, alerting us to abnormal activity.
- **Actions Taken:** Like ghostbusters, we scoured the backend servers, hunted down database ghosts, and chased network phantoms. Initially, we blamed it on a spectral database connection issue or spooky application code errors.
- **Misleading Paths:** We chased shadows for hours, exploring dead ends in database performance and application code, finding nothing but empty cobwebs.
- **Escalation:** With the situation getting scarier by the minute, we called in reinforcements from the infrastructure and networking teams.
- **Resolution:** After a séance with our load balancer, we exorcised the misconfiguration demons, restoring peace and harmony to our authentication servers.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause Explanation:** Our misbehaving load balancer was playing tricks, unevenly distributing traffic like a mischievous poltergeist, causing chaos in our authentication realm.
- **Resolution Details:** By casting the misconfiguration spell away and restoring balance to the load balancer, we banished the bottleneck ghosts and brought back serenity to our server cemetery.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Strengthen load balancer configuration spells to prevent misconfigurations from haunting us again.
  - Equip our load balancer with enchanted automated testing to ward off potential evil before deployment.
  - Enhance our monitoring crystal ball to quickly detect and ward off abnormal traffic patterns.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Conduct a ghostly review of load balancer configurations, ensuring they adhere to best practices and are not haunted.
  2. Develop and implement enchanted load balancer configuration testing scripts to keep the ghosts at bay.
  3. Augment our monitoring crystal ball with additional spells for load balancer performance divination.
  4. Summon all wizards for a post-mortem séance to review incident response procedures and unearth areas for improvement.
  5. Update our incident response spellbook with specific incantations for load balancer misconfigurations.

In conclusion, the outage was a result of mischievous gremlins infiltrating our load balancer, causing chaos in our authentication kingdom. Through vigilant detection, swift escalation, and mystical resolution, we banished the misconfigurations and restored harmony to our servers. Moving forward, we'll continue to fortify our defenses and cast protective spells to prevent similar incidents in the future.
